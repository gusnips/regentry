 * and stop saying it the moment the work ends. The panel band, the driven tab's

 * cleared when a direct session closes (stop and idle expiry included).
 *
 * The socket, the run engine and the browser are all mocked: this drives the
 * request wiring and the activity transitions, not CDP or streaming.
