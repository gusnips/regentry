/**
 * The capture spine. One recorder per run, created by `startAgentRun` and armed
 * by the `document` tool.
 *
 * It captures with `Page.captureScreenshot` over the CDP session the run
 * already holds — never `Page.startScreencast`. Screencast is driven by the
 * compositor and a hidden tab stops compositing, so it records nothing exactly
 * when TabRunner runs most (an adopted tab the user switched away from, a
 * scheduled run at 3am, a minimized window). `captureScreenshot` forces a frame
 * out of a hidden tab, which makes it the only background-safe recorder there
 * is. The cost is that we get frames per action rather than a continuous
 * stream — which is what a walkthrough wants anyway.
 *
 * Two invariants earn their weight:
 *
 * - **It never attaches the debugger itself.** Chrome's "debugging this
 *   browser" infobar must not appear before the plan gate's yes. With no
 *   session, a frame is an honest gap.
 * - **Every frame is on disk before the next one is taken.** An MV3 worker can
 *   be killed mid-run; buffered frames would die with it. The manifest stays
 *   `recording` until finalize, so a boot sweep can tell an interrupted
 *   recording from a finished one and mark it `partial`.
